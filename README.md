Praxis
===========
Praxis is a sample Android app written in **Kotlin** language, which displays random jokes. The app uses **MVVM Architecture**, **Architecture Components** and **Dagger 2** to provide a robust base to the app. The **Retrofit** library is used to fetch jokes along with the **RxJava 2** and **RxAndroid 2** which handles connections asynchronously and makes the app more reliable.  

**How does magic work?**
	
- Using MVVM pattern along with the Architecture Components
- [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger) for Dependency Injection across different scopes
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit), [RxJava 2, RxAndroid 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) handles API calls
- Permissions are handled by [RxPermissions](https://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions)
- Reactive Streams to exchange stream data across an asynchronous boundary
